# Chatbot-Using-Reinforcement
# Introduction
This chatbot application is designed to provide a conversational interface for users to interact with a knowledge base. The application uses natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning to improve its responses over time.

# System Requirements

Python 

TensorFlow 

Flask 

scikit-learn 

numpy

# Installation

Install the required dependencies using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application using python app.py
Usage

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000
Type a question or message in the chat window and press enter
The chatbot will respond with an answer or a message indicating that it does not know the answer
If the chatbot does not know the answer, the question will be logged and can be viewed by an administrator

# Administrator Interface

Navigate to http://localhost:5000/admin
View the list of unknown questions and provide answers for each question
Click the "Update" button to save the answers and update the chatbot's knowledge base

# API Endpoints

/get: Returns a response to a user's question or message

/update: Updates the chatbot's knowledge base with a new question and answer

/admin: Returns a list of unknown questions for the administrator to view and update

# Code Structure

The code is organized into the following modules:

model.py: Contains the chatbot model and NLP functions

app.py: Contains the Flask application and API endpoints

templates: Contains the HTML templates for the chat window and administrator interface

# Reinforcement Learning

The chatbot uses reinforcement learning to improve its responses over time. The chatbot's knowledge base is updated based on user feedback, and the chatbot's performance is evaluated using a reward function.

# Security

The chatbot application uses Flask's built-in security features to protect against common web vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to deploy the application behind a reverse proxy and use SSL/TLS encryption to protect user data.

# Future Development

Integrate with a database to store user interactions and improve the chatbot's knowledge base
Implement additional NLP techniques to improve the chatbot's understanding of user input
Develop a user interface for administrators to view and update the chatbot's knowledge base
